This program is a derivative of the traveling salesman problem, in which a delivery service must deliver packages to certain locations
in a fictional city, Homerville, to various houses and apartments in 2 apartment complexes, the Bart Complex and Lisa Complex, in
the fewest amount of time, the lowest cost, and the fewest number of trucks and workers.
There are 10 txt files that are read into the program, and each txt file contains the number of packages that must be delivered,
the addresses of the houses and apartment complexes, and the day of the txt files.

Homerville is divded into streets and avenues, with a certain amount of streets and avenues for each.
